# system_dynamics

This project for Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University at my 2nd Electrical year  
Given a LTI system in the following form:  
                                                     Σ𝑎𝑘𝑑(𝑘)𝑦𝑑𝑡𝑘𝑛𝑘=0 = Σ𝑏𝑖𝑑(𝑖)𝑢𝑑𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑖=0  
where (1) u is the input signal, y is the output signal, (2) a’s and b’s are arbitrary real parameters, (3) m and n are arbitrary integer, and (4) m ≤ n.
You are required to write your own program for computing and visualizing the system output for any input signal u. Your program must have at least the following specifications:-
1- You can use MATLAB or Python.  
2- A GUI for entering system parameters like n, m, a’s, and b’s.  
3- A GUI for selecting the input type (unit impulse, unit step).  
4- A GUI for visualizing (plotting) the input and output signals.  
5- The program computes the state space representation matrices (A, B, C, D) of the system.  
6- A GUI to plot or visualize the system states (x1(t), x2(t), x3(t), … , xn(t)).  
7- You are not allowed to use any ready-made libraries or functions to implement your simulation.  
8- Your program must be able to simulate up to fourth order systems.  
9- You may use the available programming libraries for generating the system parameters (a’s and b’s) as random numbers.
