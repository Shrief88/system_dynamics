# system_dynamics


This is the Final assignment for system Dynamics 2nd Electrical year, the goal of this assignment is computing and visualizing the output of the system for input signal (unit step, unit impulse) and draw the state space of the system by using numerical methods and computes the state space representation matrices (A, B, C, D) of the system. 

the program asks the user to input order of output (n) and order of input (m) and determine the input type unit step or unit impulse and enter values of a’s and b’s.
In the first gui the program asks the user to enter the data and when the user push the confirm button the second gui opens to plot the input then the third gui opens to plot the output and finally the fourth gui opens to plot the state.  

You will find the description for the numerical approximations in the first and second page in System Dynamics Report pdf
